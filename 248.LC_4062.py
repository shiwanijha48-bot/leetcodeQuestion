You are given two integer arrays source and target.

In one operation, you may choose two distinct indices i and j in source, along with any integer delta. Then update source as follows:

source[i] = source[i] + source[j] - delta
source[j] = delta
Return true if it is possible to make source equal to target after performing the operation any (including zero) number of times. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: source = [1,2,3], target = [0,2,4]

Output: true

Explanation:

Choose indices i = 0 and j = 2, and set delta = 4.
Before operation, source[0] = 1 and source[2] = 3.
After the operation,
source[0] = 1 + 3 - 4 = 0
source[2] = 4
Hence, source becomes [0, 2, 4], which is equal to target.
Therefore, the answer is true.
Example 2:

Input: source = [-5,-5], target = [-15,5]

Output: true

Explanation:

Choose indices i = 1 and j = 0, and set delta = -15.
Before operation, source[1] = -5 and source[0] = -5.
After the operation,
source[1] = -5 + (-5) - (-15) = 5
source[0] = -15
Hence, source becomes [-15, 5], which is equal to target.
Therefore, the answer is true.
Example 3:

Input: source = [1,2,1], target = [0,2,5]

Output: false

Explanation:

It can be shown that no matter what operations are performed, source can never be made equal to target. Therefore, the answer is false.

 

Constraints:

2 <= source.length == target.length <= 105
-109 <= source[i], target[i] <= 109
